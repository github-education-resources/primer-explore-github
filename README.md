**Exploring GitHub**

There are many places to begin your exploration of GitHub. To find trending repositories, topics and collections, go to https://github.com/explore. To browse projects from other students, go to the Global Campus [Community Exchange](https://education.github.com/globalcampus/exchange) where you can search, learn, collaborate, and share knowledge to build your portfolio and grow your network of peers. Need inspiration? Find a [Campus Expert](https://githubcampus.expert/explore) in your area and go to their GitHub profile to see what repositories they’ve starred and added to their lists.

**About Stars**

You can star repositories and topics to keep track of projects you find interesting and discover related content in your news feed. Starring makes it easy to find a repository or topic again later. You can see all the repositories and topics you have starred by going to your stars page. When you star repositories or topics, GitHub may recommend related content on your personal dashboard. 
Starring a repository also shows appreciation to the repository maintainer for their work. Many of GitHub's repository rankings depend on the number of stars a repository has. In addition, [Explore](https://github.com/explore) shows popular repositories based on the number of stars they have.
